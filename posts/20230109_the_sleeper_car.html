The Sleeper Car
<p>
My friend had the idea to take the train from the west coast all the
way to the east coast, because it seemed like it would be fun, and
trains are cool. We were in Seattle for winter break, and were heading
back to the east coast for spring semester, so why not book it.
We left on 4pm Jan 5th from Seattle, and arrived in Boston jan 9th at
8pm, including a 24 hour (optional, but fun) layover in Chicago. It
was indeed fun, and trains are indeed cool.
</p>
<p>
We booked coach, but the app offered us some bids for what we would
pay to updgrade to a sleeper car. We bid 200 dollars and won, and it
was definitely worth it. 
</p>
<p>
The vibe on the train (in this case a large train on the "empire
builder" route) is somewhat similar to a plane. You spend most
of the time sitting in an tempurature controlled cabin, with a light rumbling and some background
noise. You can get up when you want to and use the bathroom, and there
are staff around who are very friendly to you. But everything is
better. The chairs are nicer. The background noise is quieter and a
pleasent rumbling pitch instead of a the high pressure squeal of the
airplane. When you get up there is a lot more room to navigate. The
cars have multiple floors and there are lots of bathrooms.
</p>
<p>
The sleeping part of the sleeper car was very good. I shared a room
with my friend, and it was very comfortable. Its defintely tight, so I
would have preferred my girlfriend be the one in the other bunk, but
its more room than a two person backpacking tent, so me and my friend
knew how to handle it. The sleeper car passengers also have
access to a shower, and a "lounge" which I never entered but seemed to
be useful for dealing with a baby, or other private activities
:suggestive smirk:. The rooms themselves also have very convincing
internal and external curtains. It is a very romantic situation if you
want it to be.
</p>
<p>
At any moment you can walk from car to car to access the dining room
or the "observation room". It feels a lot like being in a hotel than
being in a vehicle. I would go further than hotel, and say that has an
even family atmosphere. An exhibit involving trains described the
atmosphere in the first class cabins on trains during the peak of rail
transit as "convivial" which predictibly means "with life", and some
of that has definitely been preserved over the years.
</p>
<p>
If you have a sleeper car, the dining is included. This means three
very satisfying meals a day, with lunch and dinner having dessert, and
dinner having an appetizer. Part of the convivial dining experience is
that you are pointed to a seat when you enter, often with another
party occupying it, even if there are free tables availible. If you
are feeling shy, you can ask the friendly chef man to seat you alone,
but I recommend talking to the other passengers, that was one of the
most interesting parts of the experience.
</p>
<p>
We ended up talking to two ~35 year old skiiers from winnipeg who said that the
coldest it got there was "aboot negative 40 centigrade", and that ~30%
of their friends consumed weed in some form. We reported that ~90% of
college students in our circles smoked weed in some form. We talked to
a traveling nurse who had taken the empire builder train 9
times in her life, and jumped at the opportunity to answer any
questions we had about how it works. I asked her about the nurse vs
traveling nurse rivalry and that was interesting. Apparently traveling
nurses usually get the night shifts (which are better because less
supervision), and that they get paid more. Also there is a very
tangible nurse shortage.
</p>
<p>
We spent most of our time in the observation car, which is incredibly
beautiful, especially when you are going through the mountains. There
are lots more people there because its open to not just the sleeping
car passengers. I saw someone playing minecraft on a laptop, I saw a
lot of people reading.
</p>
<p>
At one point there was a mother traveling alone with her daughter,
and a father traveling alone with her daughter sat accross from
eachother. They slowly became friends over the course of the hour,
the children making the first move. They first bonded over how old they were
(9 and 8) and how many teeth they had lost (3 and 4). I overheard some
disagreements about tablet placement as they watched somethign
together, so they learned some lessons about sharing. The father ended
up fielding some hard questions that the mother seemed glad not to
answer. He handled the power scaling questions up to 3 Godzillas vs 2
Transformers very well, but had to tap out when Kaiju were brought up.
</p>
<p>
At some point the child was doing something annoying, so the father had to put
a stop to it by threatening to take away a tablet. At first I felt
angry at such cruelness and wanted to stick up for the kid. As someone
obsessed with gaming growing up, the idea of having my technology
taken away brought to mind long forgiven painful memories of having my
laptop witheld from me because it was a school night (on the day it
came in the mail!!!!!! I think barricading myself in my room in a fit of
tears was very justified!!!!!). Besides being obviously not my place to
entangle myself in this, I realized that kids do annoying stuff
sometimes, and that I did not know how I was going to deal with it
when I have kids. 
</p>
<p>
Taking away the tablet solves the problem fast, and only has to be
done a couple times before the threat is just as effective. And
despite my love of gaming, it seems obviously more healthy for a 9
year old to wander around and be curious than spend time on a
game. But taking away access would just make computer time more
scarce, which would only increase its value. But the majesty of the
app store essentially means the tablet has infinite value, so perhaps
thats not a game changer. Anyway I decided that the dad was right to
threaten to take away the tablet.
</p>
<p>
The observation car had a cafe selling snacks and small meals below
it, and the vendor had a very fun time on the mic. He would fill his
speech with personality and finish it off every time with "and of course we
have ice...           cold.......          beer.......", lasting at
least 15 seconds. I encourage you to try to hold a 5 second cheeky pause in
conversation for emphasis, it is very fun to reenact.
</p>
<p>
Also witnessed in the observation car the first time I had ever seen
an amish family. Mainly living in big cities, it seems absurd that
there exist people without technology. But predictibly they were just
like normal people but in matching homemade clothes, long dresses,
long beards, and tall black hats. I overheard a conversation between
the father of one of the amish families, and another passenger who was a
construction site director. They talked a bit of shop about
construction and farming and cows and beans and family life. At one point the
construction manager had is iphone going and tapped around google maps
while being directed by the Amish father to find the closest town to
where they lived. Apparently there is an epic Amish-goods-only store
on highway 20 in Washington which I havent noticed despite driving it
a couple times.
</p>
<p>
30m later I overheard someone with a pink tie-died monster energy
shirt say the word "alias" which is a common term to mean screen name
in the discord/gameosphere.
</p>
<p>
I read the first 10 pages of dune, and was smacked in the face with
how dense the sentences were. Skimming twitter threads, reddit
comments, and github readmes are very different than
reading a proper book (with an unfamiliar author). I had to reread each
paragraph like twice, and enjoyed it immensely.
</p>
<p>
The first chapter mentions the near-supernatual Bene Gesserit power of
"being sensitive to the minutae of observation". So that is some of
what put me in the mood to observe the people around me.
</p>
<p>
After the sun goes down (at ~4pm because winter), the car becomes very
dark and calm. It spent some hours typing on my computer, reading
through notes which I had written last semester. It was very calming.
A different night I listened to five albums in a row, which to me is a
dopamine detox. I felt like I was gliding luxuriously through time,
the utter lack of control in the situation a welcome break from my normal
life full of (mostly easy) deciscions.
</p>
<p>
That night I slept in the top bunk. In the top bunk, touching the wall
would let you conduct the sound of the rumbling in a higher quality than
the walls or floor that I was used to. Occasionally there will be
some turbulence on the track that will jot the car in what seems at
first to be an unsafe velocity. The first couple times it happened my
lizard brain filled my chest with an anxiety like vertigo, that I
wanted to hold onto something to avoid being flung. But the train
moves on faithfully. To quell my chest I remember that human engineers
are very good. We have mastered the rail. We have been doing this for
at least 200 years. I also remember the tremendous power and momentum
of the machine I am inside: even if the train hit a nasty snag of some
sort on the rail, it would be the snag in trouble not me. I remember
my high school physics knowledge, and that the low center of gravity
would require the car to be almost horizontal before it would
naturally fall off the rail instead of back onto it. Mostly I remember
that there are all these people around me that I can trust. They got
on the car with me and some have done it a thousand times before. The nice lady who
asked me if I wanted a new pillowcase would also tell me if the I was
in danger. And that hard learned safety regulations would be enforced
by hard working people to ensure that people and freight get to their
destinations in one piece.
</p>
<p>
So then after all my thinking the rumbles and jolts and bumps switch
from a pressure in my chest to a childlike comfort of being rocked to sleep.
</p>
<p>
The train really is awesomely powerful. The engine car makes loud
noises, and smells like oil. Its really long, it takes like 10 minutes
to walk the length of it on stops to stretch your legs. It goes about
as fast, or slower than a car most of the time, but feels much more
inevitable and unstoppable than driving around in a fickle car. The
feeling of epicness reminds me of something I vagluely remember seeing
on reddit, where they had an extra train or something, so they ran it
off a cliff and billed it as a spectator event. People came
from all around to witness the epicness of the weight and impact, and
I would too. I think that that would be more thrilling than Avengers
Endgame (coming from someone who really liked that movie).
</p>
<p>
You have opportunities to get off the train, sometimes for like an
hour. We stopped in Minot, North Dakota and ran out into the snow and
got a beer at a local bar (the attendant was worried that we would
miss the train even though the bar was 5m away and we had 90m a very
motherly way). The bar tender was very friendly and gave us a crash
course in Minot history. There was a flood in 2011 which divided the
city (literally, there was a new river locking an entire neighborhood away
from any good grocery store) that they were still recovering from in
some ways. She seemed proud to be running the bar which
was one of the first "real culture" places in Minot.
</p>
<p>
We stopped in Minneapolis and met our friend from high school which
was quite lovely. She gave us THC infused lemonade.
</p>
<p>
We had a 24 hour stop in Chicago. Went to two museums and got deep
dish pizza. Chicago inspires with its massive scale, buildings
reaching into the clouds, somewhat dwarfing the traincar. But the
museum of science and industry told us that railroads were key to
making Chicago what it is, so the train's edge of power remained in my mind.
</p>
<p>
The shower was fun, when it banks there is a little puddle on one side
of the shower until it unbanks and the puddle goes back to the drain.
</p>
<p>
If you have seen the movie Snowpiercer by Bong Joon-ho (highly
recommend it if you havent, spoilers in this paragraph), it is hard to avoid the analogy leaping
off the screen and into your experience. Snowpiercer takes the concept
of a stratified, winner-takes-all economy, and puts it very directly
onto the train as a metaphor. The cattle car has its residents packed
shoulder to shoulder eating barely enough to survive and often
less. The most luxurious cars have only one or two people with
decadent bars, orgies, leagues of staff, and everything you can think
of. The movie compresses the order of magnitudes difference between
the highs and lows modern society into a single line of
cars. Its very direct, perhaps a bit on the nose with its point, but
the directness and truth of the metaphor is what gives it its power.
</p>
<p>
When you are walking around the train, it is not a metaphor. The
dining/sleeper cars are entirely filled with white people, the bathrooms are
cleaner (not by design, but by less frequent use), we get served three
course meals, and have a nice lady to fix our linens. The further you
go back, the more cramped and airplane-like it is. I don't have any
solutions, but the least I can do is to not forget the metaphor. On my
train there is only one order of magnitude between the back and the
front, so it seems more acceptable. But in Bong Joon-ho's train (and
in real life), there are ~7 orders of magnitude between the front and
the back of the train, and its horrible and people starve every day.
</p>
<p>
If you're paying attention even a little bit, its hard not be sobered.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I really enjoyed the train. It was a very interesting
experience, on the order of any normal vacation. Especially if with a
loved one, the sleeper car experience is a destination in
itself. Its too easy to shove the unfairness of life under the carpet
and bathe in the luxury that I have worked hard for. But it is unfair. I was born in
the sleeper car. I must cling on to the imagery of Snowpiercer, I cant
let its message slip out of convenience. I must do the best I can to
make the world a better place.
